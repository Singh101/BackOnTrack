# BackOnTrack
This site was made as a team for our school's hackathon (in collaboration with Canada Learns Code) where we had to use HTML to solve an issue.
Our team chose to tackle the issue of finding employment for immigrants, seniors and those who want to find a new career path.
We used HTML to prototype how our website would look.
Here's a link to our site: https://backontrack.glitch.me
